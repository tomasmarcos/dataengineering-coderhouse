# dataengineering-coderhouse
Repo project for the dataengineering course, from coderhouse. 
## It'll be divided into stages (many projects) and then the final project will be uploaded.

The idea is to gather data from Argentina's central bank and do some interesting charts, perhaps analyze seasonality and do some predictive analytics.
